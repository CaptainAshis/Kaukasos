    "This kernel shows how to use NBSVM (Naïve Bayes - Support Vector Machine) to create a strong baseline for the [Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge) competition. NBSVM was introduced by Sida Wang and Chris Manning in the paper [Baselines and Bigrams: Simple, Good Sentiment and Topic Classification](https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/sidaw12_simple_sentiment.pdf). In this kernel, we use sklearn's logistic regression, rather than SVM, although in practice the two are nearly identical (sklearn uses the liblinear library behind the scenes).\n",

Here is a link to the section of the video which discusses this: [Naive Bayes video](https://youtu.be/37sFIak42Sc?t=3745)."
